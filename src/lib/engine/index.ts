/**
 * K10 — multi-event simulation.
 *
 * Combines several concurrent disruption events (e.g. AOG + weather + late
 * arrival) into a single recovery search. Impacted-flight sets from each event
 * are unioned (with reasons preserved); aircraft AOG'd by any event are
 * excluded from the swap candidate pool; delay propagation uses the latest
 * event end_time so options account for the full disruption window.
 *
 * Lesson learned from Southwest 2022: a recovery tool that handles only one
 * event at a time cannot scale during cascading IROPS.
